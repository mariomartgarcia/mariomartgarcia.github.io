¡Hello! 👋 I'm a Machine Learning PhD student at the Basque Center for Applied Mathematics under the supervision of Iñaki Inza and Jose A. Lozano. My current research focuses on a specific field of machine learning, the learning using privileged information (LUPI) paradigm, which leverages relevant features unavailable at deployment time for model training. During my academic journey, I completed an internship at Ecole de Technologie Supérieure (ETS) in Montreal 🇨🇦 under the supervision of Marco Pedersoli. Before starting my PhD, I obtained my MSc in Data Science from the Open University of Catalonia 🇪🇸 and my BSc in Physics from the University of Murcia 🇪🇸.

Research interests: I work in applied AI 🤖, focusing on leveraging privileged information 💡, knowledge distillation 📚, and multi-task learning 🔄 to improve model performance in practical applications. I am particularly interested in applying these techniques to enhance decision-making in clinical 🏥 and sports environments 🏅, providing innovative solutions to real-world problems.
