Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a Machine Learning **PhD student** at the [Basque Center for Applied Mathematics](https://www.bcamath.org/es) under the supervision of [IÃ±aki Inza](http://www.sc.ehu.es/ccwbayes/members/inaki.htm) and [Jose A. Lozano](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lhzoWpwAAAAJ&hl=es). My current research focuses on learning using privileged information (LUPI), which leverages relevant features unavailable at deployment time for model training. During my academic journey, I completed an internship at [Ecole de Technologie SupÃ©rieure (ETS)](https://www.etsmtl.ca/) in Montreal ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ under the supervision of [Marco Pedersoli](https://profs.etsmtl.ca/mpedersoli/). Before starting my PhD, I obtained my MSc in Data Science from the [Open University of Catalonia](https://www.uoc.edu/es) ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ and my BSc in Physics from the [University of Murcia](https://www.um.es/) ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸.

**Research interests:** I work in applied AI ðŸ¤–, focusing on leveraging privileged information, knowledge distillation, and multi-task learning to improve model performance in practical applications. I am particularly interested in applying these techniques to enhance decision-making in clinical and sports environments, providing innovative solutions to real-world problems.
