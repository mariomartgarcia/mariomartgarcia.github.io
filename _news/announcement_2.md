_Extending the learning using privileged information paradigm to logistic regression_ is accepted at Neurocomputing

---

ðŸ¤” Have you ever discarded variables simply because they were not available at evaluation time?

ðŸ’¡These variables, known as __privileged information__, were first introduced in the learning process by Vapnik with Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Privileged variables are available as additional information at training time but they are not available at evaluation time. In our latest publication, the __learning using privileged information (LUPI)__ paradigm is extended to __logistic regression__, one of the most widely used models in the clinical field. Furthermore, a real-world case study related to COVID-19 is included.
